        <p>Gospel Jabber is a word or phrase guessing party game, similar to
        Hasbro's <i>Catch Phrase</i>, with a Latter-Day Saint theme.  You will
        need at least two players (and ideally a large group), and a phone or
        other mobile device to pass around the group.</p>

        <p>During play, one person, holding the device, gives verbal clues
        to their team to get them to guess the secret, randomly-chosen
        phrase.  If their team correctly guesses the phrase before the timer
        expires, then they pass the device to another person; this repeats
        until time runs out.</p>

        <h2>Traditional rules</h2>

        <p>Players divide into two even teams, and sit in a circle; with
        seats alternating between members of the two teams.</p>

        <p>One player chooses a category and starts the game.  The timer
        will begin, and a random phrase is displayed.</p>

        <p>The player gives verbal clues to their team mates, who try to
        guess the phrase.  Clues that contain the word or phrase, or parts
        of the phrase, are not allowed.  For example, if the phrase was
        “swimming pool”, then the clue “a place where people swim” is not
        allowed; neither are clues like “it rhymes with tool,” or “it starts
        with an ‘S.’”  If the clue-giver gives a clue that is not permitted,
        then they must skip that phrase and start over on a new one.</p>

        <p>If their team mates correctly guess the phrase, then the player
        passes the device to a member of the opposing team, who presses the
        green “next” button to advance to the next phrase and starts giving
        clues to their team.  Play continues, alternating between teams,
        until time runs out.</p>

        <p>When the timer expires, a buzzer will sound and a message will be
        displayed on-screen.  The team that was guessing the phrase when
        time expires loses the round, and the opposing team is awarded one
        point.  If the timer expires while the device is being passed from
        one person to the next, then no points are awarded.</p>

        <p>Repeat until one team has reached a pre-determined number of
        points; such as five or ten points.</p>

        <h2>Variations</h2>

        <p>The "normal" timer mode ticks with increasing frequency, giving a
        hint when the time will expire.  The "silent" timer mode does not
        make any ticking noises.  In "casual" mode, the timer is disabled.
        This mode is suitable for a non-competitive activity.</p>

        <p>The game lends itself to adaptation and house rules.  One common
        variation is to permit the clue-giver to skip one (or more) phrases
        if they cannot describe the selected phrase; this can make the game
        more fun for people that don't recognize some of the names or places
        that are selected.</p>

        <h2>Using this app</h2>
        
        <p>There are several categories that may be selected from the
        start page.  The “All topics” category combines the phrase lists
        for all of the specific topics.  The "Simplified list" category
        contains a subset of terms from the various categories, picked to
        be more suitable for younger or less-experienced players.</p>

        <p>There is an option to include or exclude a set of terms that
        are considered more difficult, amounting to around 10% of the phrase
        list.  Disabling that will make the game somewhat easier, if you are
        finding that there are too many terms that the group playing the
        game is not familiar with.</p>

        <p>A basic scorekeeping function is built into the app for
        two-team scoring: when the timer expires, scores for each team are
        displayed.  Tap the winning team's score to award a point for the
        round.  The score is reset by returning to the main menu and
        starting a new game.</p>

        <p>This app can be installed to the home screen on most Android or
        Apple mobile devices.  Select the “Add to home screen” option on the
        start page for instructions.</p>
